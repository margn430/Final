CartoDB powered map that visualizes NYC's homeless populations in the 5 boroughs.

The original data set can be accessed via the NYC open data portal.

Description
===========
From the NYC.gov open data portal, I selected a dataset logging the homeless populations in the 5 boroughs in 2012, which is the most recent census of homless populations in the city. 

### Analysis ###
By mapping this data, we can visually understand how many homeless people live in each borough; geographic density of the tags tells us which boroughs are most populated by homeless residents via choropleth.
